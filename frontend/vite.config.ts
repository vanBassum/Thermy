// to load — which the browser reports as the dynamic import itself failing, pointing at
// the bundle rather than at its dependency. Production was fine the whole time: the
// seam was only ever exercised by a build, and `pnpm dev` is where a module is actually
// developed.
//
// A REDIRECT, not a handler that serves the bytes. Sending the browser to the source
// file puts it through Vite's normal transform, so the facade's own `react` import is
// rewritten to the same pre-bundled dependency the app imports — verified identical,
// which is the whole point of the facade. Serving these bytes here would leave that
// import bare and unresolvable.

// 404'd and `pnpm dev` opened on a home screen that could not load its own cards. That
