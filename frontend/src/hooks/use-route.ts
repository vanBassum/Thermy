// The route lives in the HASH, not the path, and that is load-bearing rather
// than a style choice: this UI is served from two mount points the build cannot
// know — the device root (`/`) and the relay's `/devices/<id>/` — and a path
// route destroys the second one. Writing "/settings" dropped the device id, so
// F5 asked the relay for a URL it has no route for (404), and a reconnect
// resolved its socket against "/" instead of the device prefix.
//
// A hash never reaches the server, so the document URL stays the mount point
// forever: relative asset URLs (vite `base: "./"`) and resolveWsUrl's
// document-directory trick keep resolving, at any nesting depth, with no
// server-side SPA fallback involved. The prefix is never parsed here — the same
// reason backend.ts knows nothing about a device id.
