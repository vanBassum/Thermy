// One page a module contributes to a shell's navigation.
//
// `id` is the identity the module's own `activate()` must register under — the
// declaration here and the registration there are matched by it, so a shell can draw a
// sidebar without loading a single byte of module code. That is the whole reason the
// pages are declared rather than discovered.
//
// `icon` is a name, not an image: a manifest crosses a wire, so it can say "lightbulb"
// but cannot hand over a component. Shells resolve names and fall back when they do not
// know one — two shells may carry different icon-set versions.

// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A UI module this firmware ships: one self-contained ES module in `www`, plus the
// contributions it advertises.
//
// Declared as an `inline static` member by the manager that owns the feature and handed
// to UiManager::Register() from its Init() — the same shape as a Setting or a command
// table, and with the same requirement: static storage duration, because the registry
// keeps the pointer for the life of the device.
//
// A module contributes PAGES and nothing else. There was briefly a second kind — a
// card, rendered into a home screen the shell owned — and it went when the shell
// stopped owning any page under a device: nothing was left to host one. The FIRST page
// declared is the landing page, so declaration order is how firmware says which of its
// features is the product.
//
// `entry` is a path inside the device's `www`, in the same vocabulary `web read` uses
// (`/index.html`), and it is STABLE rather than content-hashed. Firmware names its own
// bundle, which it could not do if the frontend build were free to rename it. A shell
// resolves this against the device's base — its own origin locally, `/devices/<id>/`
// through the relay — and never imports it raw.
