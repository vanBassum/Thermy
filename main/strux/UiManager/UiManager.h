// The registry of UI modules this firmware ships, and the one command that reports it.
//
// `ui modules` is how a shell — the device's own, or the relay's — learns which pages a
// device offers. It is a COMMAND and not a file in `www`, for the same reason `help
// list` and `settings list` are commands: the command surface is how this device
// describes itself, and its HTTP server hands static files to a browser on the LAN and
// does nothing else. Two things fall out of that and both are worth having:
//
//   • one mechanism for both shells — a shell reached through the relay asks the same
//     question the same way, over the pipe it already has,
//   • the answer cannot go stale, because it never passes through the relay's file
//     cache the way a `modules.json` would have.
//
// Nothing here knows what a module *is* beyond its declaration. The bundle is bytes in
// `www` that a shell imports; this manager says which ones exist and what they claim to
// contribute, and the claim is matched against what the module registers on activation.

    // because one party owns the firmware and both shells (see docs/reasoning). It
    // versions the whole host contract, the frontend runtime included, so a React major
    // in the shells moves it.
    // 2 since the contract grew `upload`, `download` and `logs`: a firmware module
    // that writes a partition or tails the log cannot run on a shell that speaks 1, so
    // the minimum moved with it. A v1 shell meeting this device says "needs a newer
    // shell" and keeps working otherwise, which is what the range is for.
