// A WebSocket the owner READS, rather than one that calls the owner back.
//
// This is the whole reason the relay can look like the browser socket. The
// high-level esp_websocket_client owns a task and delivers frames through a
// callback, and a callback cannot be the bottom of a streaming handler: the handler
// asks for its next chunk, that chunk is only read when the client's loop runs
// again, and the loop only runs once the callback returns — which it cannot,
// because the handler is inside it. A second task plus a queue of heap-copied
// frames was the way around that, and the queue is what dropped chunks under load.
//
// One floor down, the same handshake and framing are an ordinary blocking read. So
// this is just connect / ReadFrame / SendBinary, and one task does both halves of a
// request. What the client used to do for us and this now does: pick the URL apart,
// and report a dead link so the caller can reconnect. Control frames stay someone
// else's problem — configured not to propagate them, the transport answers a ping
// and completes a close inside the read we are already making.
