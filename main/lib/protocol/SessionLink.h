// The transport seam under Session: turn an already-framed session chunk into wire
// bytes, and pull inbound wire bytes back as chunks. This is the ONLY
// per-transport code — Session and every command handler are written against this
// interface and are identical across transports.
//
// This header, SessionProtocol.h, Session.h and CommandEnvelope.h are the whole of
// the protocol layer, depending on nothing but Stream and the JSON helpers. They
// live in lib/ rather than under a transport because the transports depend on them,
// not the reverse.
//
// Implementations, each owned by the manager that owns its transport:
//   WsSessionLink    — the local browser socket. One chunk = one WS binary frame;
//                      inbound frames are read synchronously on the httpd task.
//   RelaySessionLink — the outbound socket to the relay server. Also a synchronous
//                      read, on the task that runs the command. See
//                      docs/reasoning/2026-08-05-13h55-owning-the-read-removes-the-buffer.md.
//
// Both are now the same shape, and that is worth stating because it was not always
// true: the relay used to receive frames on a WebSocket library's own task and hand
// them across on a queue, which cost a heap allocation per frame and silently
// dropped chunks when the queue filled. RecvChunk being an actual read on the
// calling task is what a streaming handler needs, and now both have it.
//
// SendRaw takes a WHOLE pre-framed chunk rather than (session, flags, payload):
// Session assembles the 3-byte header and the payload into one external buffer,
// so a flush is a single send with no extra copy. A (session, flags, payload)
// signature would reintroduce that copy on every chunk — including every chunk
// of a multi-MB firmware image.

    // one is available. On success returns the payload length (>= 0), fills
    // *sid / *flags from the 3-byte header, and leaves the payload at
    // buf + HEADER_LEN. Returns -1 on error, an over-long chunk, or end of
    // stream — the caller treats -1 as EOF.
