// The request envelope, and the sequence that runs one session against a
// dispatcher. This is protocol, not dispatch: knowing where the envelope ends and
// what the command is called is the wire format's business, and the dispatcher
// stays name-based so it never sees a Session.
//
// A request starts with a single '\n'-terminated line of JSON; the body — if any —
// is whatever bytes follow it in the same session:
//
//     {"type":"updateWrite","partition":"ota_1"}\n<firmware bytes…>
//
// The line is *peeked*, never consumed, because the handler reads that same line
// for its own arguments. (A positional wire format would not need the peek — see
// docs/reasoning/ on why the delimiter search is what forces this.)
